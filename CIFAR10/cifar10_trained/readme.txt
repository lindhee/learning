This checkpoint (=snapshot) was saved after about 24 h of training on the CIFAR 10 data on seshat, using the original CIFAR 10 tutorial network, in commit d8e5c914fd78ccaa0625b189d80cd4cdba1b101f.

The loss function was about 0.3 and the precision @1 is 87.2%.

To use it, check out the commit above and copy the contents of this folder to /tmp/cifar10_train/. Then run cifar10_eval.py to evaluate it.
